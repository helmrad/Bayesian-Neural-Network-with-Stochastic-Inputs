This code generates a Bayesian feedforward fully-connected neural network. Given a dataset of samples and targets, this type of Bayesian neural network receives, additionally to the sample, a stochastic input. The stochastic input, described by a parameterized probability distribution, is meant to account for unobserved features that are not present in the dataset. It allows for modelling complex stochastic effects like multimodality and heteroscedasticity.

The weights of the neural network, described by a parameterized multidimensional probability distribution, and the aforementioned stochastic inputs are trained by Bayesian inference. In particular, black-box &alpha-divergence minimization is used [Hern√°ndez-Lobato et al. 2015] to fit the parameters to a dataset. The code is tailored to Python 3.6 and requires the library autograd.
